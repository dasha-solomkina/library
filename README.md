# Library Project
The main goal of this project is to create a Library app that allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, displaying, and removing books, as well as changing their read status. This project was completed as part of the course: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). The code was written independently, without following any video or text tutorials, solely based on the concepts studied in the course.

## Key Features
- **New Book Form**: A “Add Book” button brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book, including author, title, number of pages, and read status.
- **Remove Books**: Button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Button on each book’s display to change its read status, with a function to toggle the read status on the Book prototype instance.
- **Tools**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
